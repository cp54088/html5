        <h2>Phi Phi Island</h2>
        <p>This place is one of the most famous landmarks in all of Thailand. Its a wonderful sight
            to see. And of course you can view it from a beach right on the bright colored water. The island 
            is also surrounded by mountains all around. Your need to go see it!

        <h2>Grand Palace and Wat Phra Kaew</h2>
        <p>The palace is such a beautiful place. It is famous for a reason, shining with bright hues 
            and covered in gleaming gold. The area surrounding also has such unique plants and trees. 
            We had to spend time walking around.

        <h2>Bangkok</h2>
        <p>This famous city is amazing to view at night. During the day it's filled with people 
            going about their days, but at night it has a whole new feel. All the lights throughout 
            the city makes it stunning after the sun sets. We got such amazing pictures.

        <h2>Damnoen Saduak Floating Market</h2>
        <p>We both love to go shopping, especially when it's a completely new experience. The floating 
            market was so lively the entire time we were there. It's something everyone should see at 
            least once. It was amazing to just ride the boat and watch the flow of the market.

        <h2>Erawan National Park</h2> 
        <p>Thailand is such a beautiful country. This national park is a prime example of the natural 
            beauty you can see when you visit. The park is filling with so many waterfalls. Walking though 
            the park is such a relaxing experience, just listening to the water and animals. It is great 
            to just take a minute and appreciate nature.
