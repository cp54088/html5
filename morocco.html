        <h2>Morocco</h2>
        <p>We had the best time seeing Morocco! We saw the amazing buildings of the Kasbah.
            When you are standing there, looking around you feel like your brought back in time. 
            It's like standing in an ancient city.</p>

        <h2>Chouara Tannery</h2>
        <p>This world famous tannery in the city of Fez is really something else. You get to actually
            see people dying fabrics and animal skins. You can even buy products hand made there. It's 
            something everyone needs to see at least once.

        <h2>Sahara Desert</h2>
        <p>You might think that sleeping in the middle of a desert is insane, but it's really a 
            magnificent experience. We rode camels into the desert to a small camp with seperate 
            tents. But instead pf sleeping inside we slept under the stars. It was amazing.

        <h2>Jemaa el-Fnaa Market</h2>
        <p>If you love cultural shopping squares and markets, this is somewhere you need to go. The 
            entire square is filled with small shops and merchants selling all kinds of things. It is a 
            tourist hotspot for a reason. All the handmade things people are selling make such great 
            souvenirs.

        <h2>Hassan II Mosque</h2> 
        <p>This famous mosque is beautiful inside and out. Morocco has such stunning architecture, 
            with this landmark being no exception. You can see the artistic genius and detail put into 
            every signle inch of construction. We had to take some pictures before leaving.
