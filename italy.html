        <h2>Trevi Fountain</h2>
        <p>On our first day in Italy, we visited the city of Rome. We saw the famous Trevi Fountain
        designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi. It was a stunning sight to witness. 
        We recommend that you go see this fountain and take many pictures. The detail is truly astounding.</p>

        <h2>Roman Colosseum</h2>
        <p>When in Rome, you need to go see the Colosseum. It looked just like the pictures.
        It was gigantic! We got there just in time to get a good look around before it closed.
        The inside was way different from what we expected. We thought it would be an empty 
        arena but it was definitely not. You'll just have to see to find out.</p>

        <h2>Cathedral and City of Florence</h2>
        <p>On our trip we also spent time touring the city of Florence. Like the rest of the sights
        we have already seen, Florence was lovely. While walking through the city we saw the Florence 
        Cathedral. Zara just had to stop and take a picture, We think it turned out pretty good. What do you think?

        <h2>Amalfi Coast</h2>
        <p>During our trip we visited the Amalfi Coast. It is breathtaking. It's a vast coastline with 
            cliffs, beaches, and quaint fishing villages. While there, you can also see the beautiful 
            vineyards and lemon groves. Amalfi Coast is such a unique place.

        <h2>Royal Palace of Caserta</h2> 
        <p>
            This famous royal palace is dazzling. Even if you only go for a few hours, we think it will be well 
            worth your visit. The halls and rooms are covered in gold. We can't forget to mention all the traditional and 
            expensive furniture throughout. The Royal Palace of Caserta is truly fit for a king.

        <h2>Venice</h2>
        <p>
            What trip to italy would be complete without visiting Venice. The whole city is made up of
            canals. Cassie and I loved the ride on the gandola. We could pretend we were in a movie. Everyone needs to go 
            at least once.
