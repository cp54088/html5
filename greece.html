        <h2>Oia</h2>
        <p>This town was right on the coast and absolutely stunning. The water is a striking
            shade of blue and there are cute white houses all throughout the town. Its a perfect 
            place to get a ton of pictures. The houses built into the cliff make the whole place
            really unique.
        </p>

        title="Parthenon"/>
        <h2>Parthenon</h2>
        <p>Of course we had to go see the Parthenon! This symbol of Greece was unbelievable to
            see in person. The famous landmark looks just like it does in the all photos, except 
            it looks MUCH bigger in person. Go see for yourself.
        </p>

        <img src="petani.jpg" width="900"
        alt="Petani Beach"
        title="Petani Beach"/>
        <h2>Petani Beach</h2>
        <p>The entire country of Greece has such beautiful beaches and ocean views. We had to spend
            time admiring the beach from up close. The water is so clear no matter where you are. There 
            is nothing like relaxing on a beach, especially if it's a beach in Greece.

        <img src="athens.jpg" width="900"
        alt="Athens"
        title="Athens"/>
        <h2>Athens</h2>
        <p>This capital city is filled with tons of historical landmarks and museums that you could visit
            for days. Even so, its amazing to just walk through the city streets and enjoy the atmosphere.
            There's a completely different feel you get while strolling through these streets.
        </p>

        <img src="cave.jpg" width="900"
        alt="Melissani Cave"
        title="Melissani Cave"/>
        <h2>Melissani Cave</h2> 
        <p>There is nothing like sitting in a boat and slowly making your way through this cave. 
            Melissani Lake, or Melissani cave is famous for just how gorgeous it is. We agreed with
            the common opinion. The hue of the water and the sunlight shining in makes you feel like
            you're in a whole new world.
