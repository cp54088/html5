        <h2>Oia</h2>
        <p>This coastal town is absolutely stunning. The water is a striking
            shade of blue and there are cute white houses all throughout the town. Oia is the perfect 
            place to take a ton of pictures. The houses built into the cliff make the whole place
            really unique.

        <h2>Parthenon</h2>
        <p>Of course we had to visit the Parthenon! This symbol of Greece was unbelievable to
            see in person. The famous landmark looks just like it does in photos, except 
            it is much bigger in person than I imagined. Go see for yourself.

        <h2>Petani Beach</h2>
        <p>Greece has many beautiful beaches and spectacular views of the ocean. We had to spend some 
            time admiring the beach. The water is so clear no matter where you are. There 
            is nothing like relaxing on a beach, especially if it's a beach in Greece.

        <h2>Athens</h2>
        <p>This capital city is filled with tons of historical landmarks and museums that you can visit
            for days. Even so, it's amazing to just walk through the city streets and enjoy the atmosphere.
            There's a completely different feel you get while strolling through these streets.

        <h2>Melissani Cave</h2> 
        <p>There is nothing like sitting in a boat and slowly making your way through this cave. 
            Melissani Lake, or Melissani cave is famous for just how gorgeous it is. We agreed with
            the common opinion. The hue of the water and the sunlight shining in makes you feel like
            you're in a whole new world.
